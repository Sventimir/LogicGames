A Haskell implementation of the popular game. In order to compile the program, you need just to run:

$ make

The binary should appear in bin/ directory. This should work on either Linux or Windows with GHC 7.6.3.

For the moment program is unable to generate random seuences, so you have to have your friend input it for you. Generation of random sequences and saving configuration to a file are features to be implemented with top priority.
